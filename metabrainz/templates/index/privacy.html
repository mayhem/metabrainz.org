    you choose to donate to support the MusicBrainz project. Any personal
    information you choose to provide during the donation process will not be
    revealed to anyone else, unless you give us permission to list your name on
    our donations page. We will not contact you unless you give us permission
    to do so when you make a donation.') }}

    {{ _('When you make a donation to the MetaBrainz Foundation, we are legally
    required to collect your personal information and keep it in our records
    in case we ever get audited by the IRS. We will not disclose your personal
    information to anyone else, ever.') }}

    made to us on this site. We will only list your name and the amount of the

    against our servers. These logs include the usual stuff: your IP address,
    your browser\'s "User-Agent" string, and which page you requested.') }}

    {{ _('Reasonable exceptions may apply to the above policy, for example to comply
    with applicable laws. The MusicBrainz/MetaBrainz server administrators
    (about three people in all) can of course see any information on the system
    they want to, but to be honest they\'re probably not interested enough to look.') }}
