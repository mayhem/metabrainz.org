"The MetaBrainz Foundation practices a policy of <i>transparent "
"finances</i> where the finances of the non-profit\n"
"    are freely available on this web site. This financial philosophy "
"allows the monetary contributors to MetaBrainz\n"
"    and information contributors to MusicBrainz to see how the non-profit"
" spends the donations and license fees it\n"
"    collects. Since MusicBrainz was built with volunteer effort and "
"MetaBrainz is supported in part by volunteer\n"
"    donations, we believe that our contributors have the right to see how"
" the non-profit manages its finances."
